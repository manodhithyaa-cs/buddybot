## 🖌️ UI Design Tips

- Message bubbles with rounded corners and subtle shadows create a soft, tactile feel.  
- Use animated typing dots in coral to show the bot is “alive” and responding.  
- Add a small bot avatar with a smiling robot icon in soft blue to create character.  
- Use micro-interactions — gentle button hover effects, smooth scrolls, and quick fade-ins for messages.  
- Keep the layout clean with generous padding and spacing to avoid clutter.  
- Support dark mode with matching darker shades but keeping the friendly vibe intact.

## 🤖 Personality Notes for AI Responses

- Use casual, friendly language with emojis sprinkled naturally for warmth.  
- Add small typing delays (0.5-1.5 seconds) before bot replies to simulate natural typing.  
- React to user emotions or keywords with empathetic or playful responses.  
- Keep jokes lighthearted and non-offensive.  
- Use polite confirmations for reminders and weather requests, e.g.,  
  “Got it! I’ll remind you to…” or “Here’s the weather in…”
